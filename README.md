## How is made. 🛠
QualityScaler is completely written in Python, from backend to frontend. 
External packages are:
- AI  -> torch / onnxruntime-directml
- GUI -> customtkinter
- Image/video -> OpenCV / moviepy
- Packaging   -> Pyinstaller

## Make it work by yourself. 👨‍💻
Prerequisites.
- Python installed on your pc, download from here (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3119/)
- VSCode installed on your pc, download from here (https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Getting started.
- First of all, you need to download the project on your PC (Green button Code > Download ZIP)
- Extract the project directory from the .zip
- Now you need to download the AI models (github won't let me upload them directly because they are too big)
- In "AI-onnx" folder, there is the link to download the AI models, download the .zip and extract the files in AI-onnx directory
- Open the project with VSCode (just Drag&Drop the project directory on VSCode)
- Click on QualityScaler.py from left bar (VSCode will ask you to install some plugins, go ahead)
- Now, you need to install dependencies. In VSCode there is the "Terminal" panel, click there and execute the command "pip install -r requirements"
- Close VSCode and re-open it (this will refresh all the dependecies installed)
- Just click on the "Play button" in the upper right corner of VSCode
- Now the app should work

## Requirements. 🤓
- Windows 11 / Windows 10
- RAM >= 8Gb
- Any Directx12 compatible GPU with  >=  4GB VRAM

## Features.
- [x] Easy to use GUI
- [x] Images and Videos upscale
- [x] Multiple AI models
- [x] Automatic image tiling and merging to avoid gpu VRAM limitation
- [x] Resize image/video before AI upscaling

    - [x] Optimizing video frame resize and extraction speed
    - [x] Multi GPU support (for pc with double GPU, integrated + dedicated)
    - [x] Python 3.10 (expecting ~10% more performance)
- [x] 2.X versions
    - [x] New, completely redesigned graphical interface based on @customtkinter
    - [x] Upscaling images and videos at once (currently it is possible to upscale images or single video)
    - [x] Upscale multiple videos at once
    - [x] Choose upscaled video extension
    - [x] Interpolation between the original and upscaled image/video
    - [x] More Interpolation levels (Low, Medium, High)
